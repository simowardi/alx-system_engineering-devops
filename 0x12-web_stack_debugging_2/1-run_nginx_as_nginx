# Description: A Bash script to configure the container so that Nginx runs as the nginx user and listens on all active IPs on port 8080.
#              It modifies Nginx configuration files and starts the Nginx service.
#              Requirements:
#                 - Nginx must be running as the nginx user
#                 - Nginx must be listening on all active IPs on port 8080

# Modify Nginx configuration to listen on port 8080
sudo sed -i 's/80/8080/' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Set appropriate permissions for nginx.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Stop Apache2 service if running
sudo pkill apache2

# Start Nginx service as nginx user
sudo su nginx -c "service nginx start"
