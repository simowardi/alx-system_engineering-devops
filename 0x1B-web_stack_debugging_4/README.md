# Webstack Debugging 3

## Project takeaways

- When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and is the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. In this case, you will need to go down the stack, the good news is that this is something Holberton students can do :)
- Wordpress is a very popular tool, it allows to run blogs, portfolios, e-commerce and company websitesâ€¦ It actually powers 26% of the web, so there is a fair chance that you will end working with it at some point in your career.
- Wordpress is usually run on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), which is a very widely used set of tools.
- The web stack you are debugging today is a Wordpress website running on a LAMP stack.

## Task
