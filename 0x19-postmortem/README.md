# Postmortem Report: Service Outage on June 7, 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:** June 7, 2024, 09:00 - 10:15 UTC

**Impact:** Our e-commerce platform was completely inaccessible, affecting approximately 85% of our users. During the outage, users were unable to browse products, place orders, or access their accounts. This led to significant user frustration and a temporary loss of revenue.

**Root Cause:** The outage was caused by an expired SSL certificate on our primary web server, which prevented secure connections from being established.

## Timeline

- **08:55** - Monitoring alert indicates a spike in SSL connection errors.
- **09:00** - Engineering team receives automated alert and starts investigating.
- **09:10** - Initial hypothesis: Potential DDoS attack; network security team contacted.
- **09:20** - Network security team finds no evidence of an attack; focus shifts to server configurations.
- **09:30** - Misleading path: Investigation into recent application updates shows no issues.
- **09:40** - Escalation to senior infrastructure engineer.
- **09:50** - Root cause identified as an expired SSL certificate on the primary web server.
- **10:00** - SSL certificate renewed and deployed.
- **10:10** - Services gradually restored and monitored for stability.
- **10:15** - All services back to normal operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The root cause was an expired SSL certificate on the primary web server. The certificate expired at 08:55 UTC, causing all secure connections to fail. This resulted in the entire e-commerce platform becoming inaccessible to users.

**Resolution:** Once the expired SSL certificate was identified as the root cause, the certificate was promptly renewed. The new certificate was then deployed to the web server. A full restart of the web server was performed to ensure that the new certificate was correctly applied and that all services were operational. Post-recovery monitoring confirmed that the issue was resolved, and normal operations resumed.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. **Certificate Management:** Implement an automated SSL certificate management system to prevent certificates from expiring unnoticed.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Enhance monitoring to include alerts for upcoming SSL certificate expirations.
3. **Documentation:** Update documentation to include detailed procedures for SSL certificate renewal and deployment.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. **Automate SSL Renewal:** Configure an automated process for SSL certificate renewal and deployment.
2. **Add SSL Expiry Alerts:** Set up monitoring alerts for SSL certificate expiration dates, with notifications starting at least 30 days before expiry.
3. **Improve Documentation:** Update the internal knowledge base with a step-by-step guide for handling SSL certificate renewals.
4. **Conduct Training:** Hold training sessions for the engineering team on SSL certificate management and the importance of monitoring certificate expirations.
5. **Review Change Management:** Enhance the change management process to include SSL certificate expiration checks as part of regular maintenance routines.

By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent future outages and enhance the reliability of our e-commerce platform. The immediate actions and long-term measures will contribute to more stable and reliable operations, ensuring minimal disruption to our users.
